# Deep-Q-learner Call Bridge Player
Call Bridge is a simplification of Bridge. The rules of this four players card game can be found at https://www.pagat.com/auctionwhist/call_bridge.html. \
Since this card game does not admit any dominant startegy, the value of bets and plays are evaluated by Deep Neural Networks. In addition, since the number of strategies of each of the four players is enormous, they are explored by Q-learning. \
Thus, this program proposes a Deep-Q-learner Call Bridge player.
